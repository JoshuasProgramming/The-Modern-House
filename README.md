# Real Estate Website - The-Modern-House

I created a fully responsive real estate website from viewing a UX/UI design online. This website uses HTML, SASS & Responsive Design.

## Lessons Learned

I really enjoyed the process of breaking down the UX/UI design into small chunks, via divide and conquer.
The lessons learned are below:

* Re-creating a website as close as possible to the design that was given to me. 
* (updating my knowledge on) Responsive Design.
* Adding favicon to a page. 
* Creating a website ASAP.

## Challenges 

* Updating my knowledge on responsive design.
* Making each section of the page have the height and width of the ui/ux mockup.

# What I'll do next time

* Try to adjust my responsive design skills
